13.Find LIS of an array in a circular manner.
	Append the same elements(i.e. whole array) with the given array.
	For every window of size n(no. of elements in the given array), perform LIS.
	Return maximum length.
	
	{1, 4, 6, 2, 3}
	After appending elements resultant array
	will be {1, 4, 6, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 2, 3}.

	Now for every consecutive n elements perform LIS.
	1- {1, 4, 6, 2, 3} --3 is length of LIS.
	2- {4, 6, 2, 3, 1} --2 is length of LIS.
	3- {6, 2, 3, 1, 4} --3
	4- {2, 3, 1, 4, 6}-- 4 {2, 3, 4, 6}
	5- {3, 1, 4, 6, 2} --3.
	6- {1, 4, 6, 2, 3} Original list.

	So, maximum length of LIS in circular manner is 4. 	
14. Find longest bitonic sequence such that increasing and decreasing parts are from two different arrays
        Calculate LIS from 1st array and LDS from 2nd array
15. Longest Increasing Consequtive Subsequence
16. Longest subsequence such that difference between adjacents is one
17. Maximum length subsequence with difference between adjacent elements as either 0 or 1
18. Find the Longest Increasing Subsequence in Circular manner
    
Applications:
1. Size of array after repeated deletion of LIS
2. Minimum number of deletions to make a sorted sequence. (sizeOfArray - LIS)
3. Minimum insertions to sort an array. At any step we can insert any array 
   element from its position to any other position. (sizeOfArray - LIS)


    Maximum sum Bi-tonic Sub-sequence 
	construct two arrays MSIBS[] and MSDBS[]. 
	MSIBS[i] stores the sum of the Increasing subsequence ending with arr[i]. 
	MSDBS[i] stores the sum of the Decreasing subsequence starting from arr[i]. 
	return the max sum of MSIBS[i] + MSDBS[i] � Arr[i].

7. Matrices and DP
---------------

2. 	Count And Print All Possible paths in a Matrix from Top left to Bottom right with obstacles.	[TODO print path + space optimization]
3. 	Finding the Minimum Cost Path in a Grid when a Cost Matrix is given (MinCost + Path).			[TODO print path + space optimization]
4.  Maximum Path sum from any cell in first row to any cell in last row.
5.  Minimum Steps to reach any of the boundary edges of a matrix									[TODO]
6.	Minimum cost/sum path in a triangle + print the path											[TODO print path + space optimization]
7.	Maximum cost/sum path in a triangle + print the path											[TODO print path + space optimization]
8.	Number of paths with exactly k coins 
9.	Collect Maximum Coins before hitting a dead end
10.	Path with maximum average value with right and down moves
		To reach the bottom right, we can take max N-1 down moves 
		and max N-1 right moves. so there is total 2N-1 moves possible
		In average value, the denominator is fixed and we need to 
		just maximize numerator. Therefore we basically need to find 
		the maximum sum path. 
11. Collect maximum points in a grid using two traversals
