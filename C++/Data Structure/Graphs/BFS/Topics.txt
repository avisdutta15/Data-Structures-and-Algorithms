I wanted to study graph-related problems and concepts, so I went through all the graph-tagged problems—around 100 in total, 
excluding non-public and pure tree problems. Graph theory is a broad field with many algorithms and patterns, but I suggest 
mastering Parts 1 and 2 first, especially depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS). Part 3 covers many applications 
and combinations of these basics, which are essential to cover for top companies that are highly competitive in the current market.
