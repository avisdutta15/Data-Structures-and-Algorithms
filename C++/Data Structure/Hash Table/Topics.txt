2. Find a Subarray with given Sum K
3. Find all Subarray with given Sum K
4. Find Longest Subarray with given Sum K
5. Largest subarray with equal number of 0s and 1s  
	Approach 1: [Replace 0 with -1. Problem redues to finding Prob.4 with K=0]
   	Approach 2: Keep a prefix sum. When A[i] = 1 then prefix sum +=1 
					    A[i] = 0 then prefix sum -=1
		    Rest is same as above. i.e. subarray sum = 0
6. Longest subarray having count of 1s one more than count of 0s [Replace 0 with -1. Problem redues to finding Prob.4 with K=1]
7. Count subarrays with same even and odd elements [Replace odd with -1, even with 1. Then Prob.4 with K=0]
8. Continuous Subarray Sum equals multiple of K
9. Length of Largest subarray with contiguous elements. [for each subarray[i..j], if maxele-minele == j-i then it contains contiguous elements]
	for i=0 to n-1
	   for j=i+1 to n-1
		subarray [i..j].

Mod and Hashing:
---------------
Note: Sum of all remainders of elements of A when divided by K is equal to K.  A[0]%K+A[1]%K+...+A[n-1]%K=K
      a%b = K =>  a = b.j + K => a-K = b.j

Product and Hashing:
-------------------

	If arr[i] is 0 and K is also 0, return true, else ignore arr[i].
	If K % arr[i] is 0 that means there exists a b in for whom a*b=K. Find b using K/arr[i] exists in table, return true.

Quick Pattern Identification Tips:
"Find pairs/combinations that sum to X" → Two Sum pattern

"Group similar items/words" → Frequency counting

"Longest substring with at most K distinct chars" → Sliding window + hash map

"Design data structure with O(1) operations" → Hash map + other DS

"Find duplicates/missing numbers" → Array indexing or set operations

"Check if strings follow pattern" → Bi-directional mapping
