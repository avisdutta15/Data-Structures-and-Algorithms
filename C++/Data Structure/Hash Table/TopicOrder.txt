3. Mod and Hashing
Note: Sum of all remainders of elements of A when divided by K is equal to K.  A[0]%K+A[1]%K+...+A[n-1]%K=K
      a%b = K =>  a = b.j + K => a-K = b.j

Count the number of subarrays whose sum is divisible by K

4. Product and Hashing
Pair with given product | Set 1 (Find if any pair exists) [special case when prod = 0] 
   (a*b = K then K%a==0 and b = K/a)
	If arr[i] is 0 and K is also 0, return true, else ignore arr[i].
	If K % arr[i] is 0 that means there exists a b in for whom a*b=K. Find b using K/arr[i] exists in table, return true.
	Insert arr[i] into the hash table.		
Count number of triplets with product equal to given number
